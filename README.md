What is Champs Fund? 🏋️

Champs Fund is a crowdfunding platform dedicated to supporting aspiring young athletes in the Philippines who demonstrate exceptional talent but lack the financial means to participate in national competitions. Our platform bridges the gap between passionate sports enthusiasts and these promising athletes, providing an avenue to directly contribute to their dreams and ambitions.

Champs Fund specifically focuses on supporting aspiring young athletes aged 5-18 years, helping them overcome financial barriers and pursue their potential in sports.
